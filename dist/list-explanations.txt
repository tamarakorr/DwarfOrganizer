Descriptions of all the columns, their sources, and their purpose

This file is tab-delimited.

Dwarf Organizer is abbreviated "DO" throughout this file.

The values of the many columns titled "Potential" in the Dwarf List are calculated as follows:

1. The dwarf's stats are converted to percentages relative to the maximum starting stats of new dwarves. For example, if a dwarf has Strength that is 80% of the maximum Strength value for new dwarves, then the value used here is 80. The stat ranges for new dwarves were obtained from one of the early releases of Dwarf Guidance Counselor.

2. The percent values for all the stats involved in the skill are (multiplied by 100 and) averaged. (The stats involved in the skill come from the DF wiki, except where I have noted in all capital letters that they are not available there.) For example, for Surgery Potential the Agility, Focus, Spatial Sense, and Kinesthetic Sense values obtained in #1 would be averaged.  This average is then rounded, and displayed under Potential as a whole number.

3. (Note) You are likely to see some "Potential" values over 100 for dwarves in an older fort, because as dwarves increase their skill levels, their stats rise. Some stats will become higher than the highest value a migrant could be expected to achieve.

4. (Note) If a dwarf has a specific trait value that prevents learning a skill (such as a dwarf that is too straightforward to lie), then the potential for that skill will always display zero.

The many columns titled "Level" in the Dwarf List come directly from dwarves.xml (exported by Runesmith or DFHack).
